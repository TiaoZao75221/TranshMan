#TranshMan
Garbage is a large direct-link MOD that is overdone according to the survival attributes of the original, and is co-created by a large number of interested and passionate players. It is recommended to play through the original and then try to survive the extremely difficult work.
Whether you are an old player or a new player, you can experience a new feeling in the world of garbage people, terror, fear, confusion, helplessness, and only dare to rummage through garbage bags on the road.
That's the charm of the scavenger!
Zombie section: Added 114 unique zombies to the server.
Terrain section: There are a lot of unexpected dangers, such as landmines like rags, that you need to break through to other terrain.
Weapons section: All weapons have better advanced options, and you can even find some mythological gear.
Garbage part: Picking up trash is the unique fun of this module.
Skills Section :4 additional skill sets to better prepare for the Apocalypse.
Blood Moon part: Shattered, bombarded, like a nightmare.
Survival part: Survival is extremely difficult, you only have a limited number of revivals, or you die forever.
The rest, too difficult to describe, but well worth the challenge, see you in the game!
